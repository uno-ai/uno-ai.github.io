          disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
        <p>The Company will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for
          a
          shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the
          functionality
          of Our Service, or We are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.</p>
        <h3>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h3>
        <p>Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other
          places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this information may be
          transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country or other
          governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from Your jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents Your agreement
          to
          that transfer.</p>
        <p>The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in
          accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization
          or
          a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal
          information.</p>
        <h3>Delete Your Personal Data</h3>
        <p>You have the right to delete or request that We assist in deleting the Personal Data that We have collected
          about
          You.</p>
        <p>Our Service may give You the ability to delete certain information about You from within the Service.</p>
        <p>You may update, amend, or delete Your information at any time by signing in to Your Account, if you have one,
          and
          visiting the account settings section that allows you to manage Your personal information. You may also
          contact
          Us to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that You have provided to Us.</p>
        <p>Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information when we have a legal obligation or
          lawful
          basis to do so.</p>
        <h3>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
        <h4>Business Transactions</h4>
        <p>If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be transferred. We
          will
          provide notice before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h4>Law enforcement</h4>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so
          by
          law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).</p>
        <h4>Other legal requirements</h4>
        <p>The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>
          <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company</li>
          <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
          <li>Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public</li>
          <li>Protect against legal liability</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
        <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over the
          Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means
          to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
          information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child
          has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data
          from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that
          information from Our servers.</p>
        <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires
          consent
          from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.</p>
        <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third party
          link,
          You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every
          site You visit.</p>
        <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any
          third
          party sites or services.</p>

          Privacy
          Policy on this page.</p>
